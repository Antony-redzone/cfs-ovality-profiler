made avi files
Simple colour thresholding + hough implementation

2/9/02 - 2 hours

hough working, use distance to pink for segmentation

3/9/02 - 2 hours

tried contour tracing using hysteresis thresholding.
works, but gets outline of hole and misses top of circle

4/9/02 - 2 hours

tried nonmaximum supression, on raw image doesn't work well, tried with
interlace off, some improvement.

7/9/02 - 3 hours

got nonmaximum supression to work by using laplacian with offset of 2 pixels
tried radius independent hough but not very accurate.
tried zero crossings of first derivative, works well.
implemented profile tracker using contour tracing 
wrote opengl profile viewer, works ok

10/9/02 - 1 hour

better profile viewer with different views and grids

12/9/02 - 2 hours

mapping image data to profile for viewer

14/9/02 - 1 hour

VB interface testing, seems to work.

18/22/02 - 3 hours

recursive first derivative of gaussian implementation with fp math

25/9/02 - 2 hours

meeting with CBS
gaussian implementation using integer maths

26/9/02 - 2 hours

implemented edge points list to speed upfinding the profile 
implementation of circle location using random points method

27/9/02 - 2 hours

random points method works well, removed hough code and tidied source up

8/12/02 - 4 hours

get directshow working, capture is ok
use samplegrabber filter and callback

2do

overlay
file i/o
snapshot
buffer for comms with vb
faster gaussian

10/12/02 - 4 hours

did overlay by writing to bitmap
did file i/o, using more filters

11/9/02 - 4 hours

did faster gaussian using shift buffer
need to do parameter setting for video

12/9/02 - 4 hours

worked on setting video parameters
tried with other hardware
